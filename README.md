      - Maximum: $52,764 (top by Kathleen Griffin).
      - Total: Over $1.4 billion.
      - Outliers: Negative billing amounts corrected; minimum billing is now $9.
   - High-Cost Drivers:
     - Patients aged 0-18 incur the highest average bills due to specialized care.
     - The 66-100 age group has the lowest average bills.
5. Operational Metrics
   - Doctors:
      - Most Active: Michael Smith attended 27 patients and generated $784,501 in billing.
      - Highest Average Billing: Michael Martin ($37,462).
   - Hospitals:
      - Highest Admissions: LLC Smith (44 patients).
      - Lowest Admissions: Several hospitals with 1 patient each.
6. Stay Duration
   - Average stay: 15.4 days.
   - Longest Stay: 30 days.
   - Shorter Stays: Emergency admissions are generally shorter than elective ones.
   - Patients with extended stays: 27,430 had stays longer than average.
7. Trends by Admission Types
     - Emergency cases have longer average stays (15.6 days) than urgent cases (15.4 days).
     - Elective admissions have the highest total billing due to planned procedures.
## Tools and Methods
- Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas: Cleaning, processing, and feature engineering.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For detailed visualizations.
- WordCloud: To visualize frequent conditions and medications.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
 
## Visualizations
Included Charts and Graphs:
- Boxplots: Identified outliers in numerical data.
- Histograms: Distribution of patient demographics and billing amounts.
- Count Plots: Frequency of admissions by type and demographics.
- Heatmaps: Correlations between financial and operational metrics.
- Pie Charts: Gender distribution and age group representation.
  
## Results and Conclusions
The analysis highlights key areas for improving patient care and operational efficiency:

- High-Cost Drivers: Young patients (0-18 years) require specialized care, leading to higher average bills.
- Doctor Performance: A small subset of doctors generates significant revenue, underscoring the importance of skilled specialists.
- Peak Periods: Admissions spike in August, July, and early in the week, indicating the need for resource planning during these times.
